        <h2>About NIC Institute</h2>
        <p>
          NIC (National Institute of Computer) is an Institute of Professional
          Studies, ISO 9001:2015 Certified, committed to developing individuals
          into complete professionals. Since 1994, we have been in the service
          of humanity, providing high-quality education to empower students with
          technical and life skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our training method, Smart Labs Plus, ensures you learn better by
          participating and doing, rather than just listening to lectures. We
          also teach Marketing, Sales, and HRD to enhance your capabilities,
          preparing you to face lifeâ€™s challenges confidently and emerge
          stronger and successful.
        </p>
        <p>
          A high-quality education is one of the most important things we can
          provide. Exposure to diverse topics, people, and experiences
          contributes to a fulfilling institute experience. NIC is managed by
          the Cyber Information Technology Society, formed under Society Act XXI
          of 1860, with VO/NGO registration DL/2009/0023143 (NITI Aayog, Govt.
          of India).
